                            Doctorpedia is a collection of resources on different conditions and is not meant to be
                            used to diagnose or treat those conditions. We provide a guide to working through medical
                            content, but this does not constitute medical advice and you should talk with a medical
                            professional when necessary. Information published or referenced on this site is current
                            at the time of posting, but may not be the most up-to-date information available. Always
                            do your own research and consult a physician if you have questions.

                            Info at the point of publication, unfortunately website information can always be changed by the provider afterwards, so double check first.We donât as a general policy investigate the solvency of companies mentioned (how likely they are to go bust), but there is a risk any company can struggle and itâs rarely made public until itâs too late. We often link to other websites, but we canât be responsible for their content. Diabetespedia is entirely editorially independent. Its stance of putting consumers first is protected and enshrined in the legally-binding MSE Editorial Code.
